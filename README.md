Do you have a RML engine? Do you want to test its conformance with the mapping language specification?

1. Download the test-cases: https://github.com/RMLio/rml-test-cases
2. Run them over your tool and generate a results.csv file with your results. You can see and example of the output file [here](https://github.com/RMLio/rml-implementation-report/blob/master/output/rmlmapper/results.csv)
3. Create a folder into the tools-report folder with the name of your tool
4. Copy your results.csv and the rules.yarrrml.yml file to your tool folder
5. Make a pull request to the repo with the new inputs to see the results at the [RML implementation-report web page](http://rml.io/implementation-report/)
